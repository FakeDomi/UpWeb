## Notes

This does not include any font. If you want one, place the font file as `custom-font` into the root directory. The official website uses `Century Gothic`.

If you don't want to copy the templates over to your up server web template folder everytime, put `<WebFolder>..\..\..\..\UpWeb</WebFolder>` into your server config. Note that this only applies if you checked out the repositories to the same base folder. If you didn't, you need to change the reference accordingly.

You can reload the templates by running the `reload-web-content` command in the up console.
